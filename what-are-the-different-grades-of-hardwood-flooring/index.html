The major differences between a #2 common hardwood, #1 common hardwood, and a select grade hardwood mostly have to do with the wood’s appearance rather than its durability. Flooring manufacturers have their own grading standards, others may also comply with national grading rules, and some flooring styles have no grade at all — antique flooring, for example.
