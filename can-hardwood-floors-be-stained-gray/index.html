Red oak floors stained with classic gray Oak floor From pinterest.com
At lifecore, you can trust that our prestained hardwood flooring options are finished and stained with your family in mind. I was told by a someone that dark grey stains don�t wear as well as they don�t penetrate as deep as other lighter stains.
