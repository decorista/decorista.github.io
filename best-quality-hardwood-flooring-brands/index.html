Best Engineered Hardwood Flooring Brand ReviewTop 5 From royhomedesign.com
Bruce only do hardwood, which to our mind gives it an advantage over other brands that offer all sorts of flooring. In the case you have decided to go for a hardwood floor, there are factors you will need to consider to ensure quality. Ebony, cherry, live oak, or bamboo are the most durable choices. A budget $ 5.00 engineered floor with a 2mm wear layer works perfectly fine for many, even those with a household full of kids and dogs, but it will get beat up.
