      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List Of Hardwood Flooring Vs Engineered Wood For Small Room&lt;/strong&gt;, Engineered hardwood is better for more intricate designs or patterns while solid hardwood is best for a natural, wood floor appearance. The durability of solid hardwood flooring is mainly determined by the hardness of the wood specie it is made from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://decorista.github.io/img/placeholder.svg&#34; data-src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/anguloconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/engineered-hardwood-vs-laminate-wood-flooring.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Engineered Hardwood Vs Laminate Wood Flooring Flooring&#34; title=&#34;Engineered Hardwood Vs Laminate Wood Flooring Flooring&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https:\/\/decorista.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg&#39;;&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;
Engineered Hardwood Vs Laminate Wood Flooring Flooring From anguloconsulting.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineered hardwood actually has a top layer of real hardwood, whereas laminate flooring is a high quality picture of wooden flooring laminated onto high density fibreboard (hdf), not wood. If you have your heart set on traditional solid hardwood flooring and want to keep things �green�, consider opting for a species like european oak or american white oak , instead of exotic, rare. Both hardwoods and engineered wood flooring hold up well against heat. Engineered floors with a thin veneer typically cannot be refinished, however, many modern engineered wood floors are made with a thicker veneer that makes refinishing possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
