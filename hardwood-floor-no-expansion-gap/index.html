Wood flooring expands and contracts due to variances in temperature and humidity. Nevertheless, even when using this method you need to remember to leave a 1.5 mm expansion gap wherever the engineered wood flooring meets a fixed object, so as to enable expansion and contraction. Solid hardwood can develop gaps, especially after being flooded.</p>

However, it can also be caused by the direct exposure of the laminate floorboards to moisture as a result of wet mopping, neglecting to clean spills at once, or undetected leakages. Years ago all that we had was solid wood floors and these boards have a mind of there own. The first is to control the moisture in the house.</p>
<h3 id="expansion-gaps-should-be-left-wherever-the-floor-comes-up-against-a-fixed-object-for-example-next-to-a-wall-a-doorway-or-a-heating-pipe">Expansion Gaps Should Be Left Wherever The Floor Comes Up Against A Fixed Object, For Example, Next To A Wall, A Doorway Or A Heating Pipe.</h3><p>The gap between the hardwood flooring and any obstruction should be a minimum of 5/8 inch and 3/4 inch is actually better, as shown in figure 2. Proper moisture content in wood flooring and in the subfloor, along with adequate nailing, lets the flooring be installed without an expansion space. There are many products you can use during this process, depending on how big the gaps are and what kind of installation you’ve used, such as planking, nailing, or gluing. Hence, fixing the gaps in an engineered hardwood floor isn’t going to be much different than that of solid wood floors.</p>

If no expansion gap has been left, when a floor naturally expands it will have no where to go and will raise up and damage the flooring. For very wide more permanent gapping, gluing rope with a urethane adhesive between boards has been successful. As the humidity rises and falls, it’s common for gaps to form and appear in hardwood floors.</p>
