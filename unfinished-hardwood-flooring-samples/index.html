Unfinished hardwood flooring is raw wood that you will have to sand and finish after installation. However, some homeowners prefer to stain and seal their hardwood flooring themselves, in which case unstained maple wood is the best choice. Unfinished solid flooring is simply the raw material in its natural state after it has been machined into planks. Because these planks are unfinished, you can paint them whatever color you wish.
