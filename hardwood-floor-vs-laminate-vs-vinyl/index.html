Vinyl vs. Laminate Flooring Comparison and Contrast From thespruce.com
Due to their hardwearing protective surfaces, both vinyl and laminate are good, durable options for your home, far less prone to scratching and damage than hardwood floor. Laminate flooring has become being a buzzword in home design, especially in case you�d love to improve the old room of yours into a more stylish spot that is not difficult to clean up. Vinyl flooring is easier to install. Laminate, on the other hand, has a more realistic wood look that will go well with your home’s decor.
