Engineered hardwood actually has a top layer of real hardwood, whereas laminate flooring is a high quality picture of wooden flooring laminated onto high density fibreboard (hdf), not wood. If you have your heart set on traditional solid hardwood flooring and want to keep things �green�, consider opting for a species like european oak or american white oak , instead of exotic, rare. Both hardwoods and engineered wood flooring hold up well against heat. Engineered floors with a thin veneer typically cannot be refinished, however, many modern engineered wood floors are made with a thicker veneer that makes refinishing possible.
